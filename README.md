Second Year Web Development Assignment to create a dynamic Library website using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS

Website was hosted on a local xammp stack.
The database was created using MySql

The database can be created by creating a database called 'book' and importing the book.sql file into it 

The Website can then be run by launching the index.php file


The website provides search, reserve, and remove reservations operations for different user accounts on a database
Users can create accounts and all fields are error checked. Sessions are implemented to ensure users cannot access certain pages without logging in, nor can they remove the reservations of other users.
